# Through the use JavaScript, Ployly, D3.json(), and external data fetched from CSV files and web APIs, we built a website with a dashboard to display the information in charts.

## The information: 

A research company is interested in bacterial species found in navels and their potential to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Researchers have sampled the navels of individuals across the country and identified the bacterial species found. The individuals’ identities are anonymous but they can be identified with the use of ID numbers. 


## The website:
Participants and researchers can access an individual’s data through the use of our dashboard. They simply have to select the ID number from the dropdown menu and a variety of charts will display information about the bacterial species.
